# E-Vidence Server

## Description

This is my first back-end server created for my Nucamp class to be used in conjunction with my mobile application E-Vidence (a mobile evidence tracking application). 
The server was built using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.

## Usage

The server provides GET, POST, PUT and DELETE endpoints for the following tasks:
- User registration, login/logout and authentication
- Obtaining list of users as well as user information
- Adding, viewing and editing incidents or cases
- Adding, viewing and editing case information or evidence items

Currently, the application is being developed with an Android simulator (Pixel 4). Optimization for iOS will be coming. 

## Roadmap

Future updates include:
* Fully integrating it with my front-end application; I still have a few endpoints to tie together.
* I plan to add camera functionality; being able to add quick photographs of evidence items in the field would be a nice feature, especially when weather or other factors might
prevent us from documenting evidence with our DSLR cameras
* Full integration with the desktop/web version once I finish building it.
* I hope to optimize it for iOS when I finish it up for Android
